            <h2>Solution: Automating Quality Control in Light Manufacturing</h2>
            <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Manual quality control in light manufacturing is often slow, prone to human error, and costly, leading to production inefficiencies and potential defects reaching customers.</p>
            <p><strong>Our Solution:</strong> We implement an AI-driven automated quality control system leveraging computer vision and n8n workflow automation to detect defects in real-time, streamline processes, and provide actionable insights.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="how-it-works">
            <h3>How Our Solution Works:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Data Acquisition:</strong> High-resolution cameras capture images/videos of products on the assembly line.</li>
                <li><strong>AI-Powered Defect Detection:</strong> Our <a href="../services/ai-services.html">AI Services</a> (specifically computer vision models) analyze these images to identify defects based on pre-trained criteria (e.g., scratches, misalignments, incorrect components).</li>
                <li><strong>Workflow Automation with n8n:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Detected defects trigger an <a href="../services/n8n-expertise.html">n8n workflow</a>.</li>
                        <li>The workflow can automatically flag defective items, reroute them for inspection, or halt production if critical issues are found.</li>
                        <li>Alerts are sent to relevant personnel (e.g., via email, Slack, SMS).</li>
                        <li>Data is logged into a quality management system or database.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Reporting & Analytics:</strong> Dashboards provide insights into defect rates, types, and trends, enabling continuous process improvement. (Optionally using <a href="../services/rag.html">RAG</a> for natural language querying of QC data).</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Conceptual Use Case: Electronics Assembly Plant (SEA Market)</h3>
            <p>A light electronics assembly plant in Vietnam faced challenges with inconsistent quality in soldering on PCBs. Our solution integrated cameras at key checkpoints. AI models trained to identify soldering defects (bridges, cold joints) flagged issues. An n8n workflow immediately alerted the station supervisor and logged the defect, leading to a 15% reduction in rework and a 5% increase in first-pass yield within 3 months.</p>
